instructions - each developer creates his Components inside frontend/src/Components/<componentName>,

after finishing the component, update the "UI ToolKit.text" in the scheme:

<componentName> -
Props required: <list of props by order!>
Hooks needed: <list of hooks>

*To Everyone - notice that you use Aviv's generic color by the definition, do not use colors code!

Nir - the mainTheme is the app itself, do not build the theme on the components folder, do it as the generic css and design the app component itself.
